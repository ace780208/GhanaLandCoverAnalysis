# GhanaLandCoverAnalysis
 The python scripts are built based on ArcGIS arcpy library to extract land cover area from Landsat-derived land cover maps
## four .py files in this repository
including
* dist_LCLU.py
* get_LCinfo.py
* clipBuiltforLCLU.py
* OLS.py

### dist_LCLU.py
This python-based script for arcGIS toolbox of extracting built-up area for each district in 2000 and 2010.

### get_LCinfo.py
This is the python script based on ArcGIS arcpy library for extracting the areas of agriculture and natural vegetation land cover from 2000 and 2010 land cover maps.

### clipBuiltforLCLU.py
This is a python script for arcGIS toolbox to extract built-up area for each district in Southeastern Ghana within 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 km buffer of major road (i.e. highway) for 2000 and 2010.

### OLS.py
This python script is for calculating R2 and p-value for each combination of population and built-up area (and their derivatives).
